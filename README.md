I am an economics PhD Fellow at the University of Pretoria where I also teach principles of macroeconomics. My current research is on the impact of commodity price shocks and financial frictions on unemployment in small open economies. My research interests include monetary economics, computational and quantitative macroeconomics. I have good programming skills in EViews, Stata and MATLAB.
